## Professional Biography
Hello, I am Tyler Brunelle, a senior Computer Science student at the University of Cincinnati.
Prior to attending UC, I grew up in Columbus, Ohio.
I spent much of my youth in a pool, either competitively swimming or playing water polo.
I enjoyed my studies, particularly math and science.
I eventually found my way into a Multimedia course, which sparked my interest in computer science.
That course taught me basic animation, graphic design, coding, and web design.
In 2021, I graduated with honors from Pickerington High School North.  

Now at Cincinnati, I thrived in my intro engineering and programming courses, loving every second of my classes.
However, during my first co-op I realized something was missing.
I missed structure, a strong community, and fellow motivated individuals.
I found that through the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) program at UC.
I have gained valuable communication, critical thinking, and leadership skills throughout that program.
The community and sense of belonging were found.  

Going into my fifth and final year here at UC, I am excited to take on the challenge of this Senior Design project!

## Project Sought
I intend to create a video game version of a board game.
This board is an Air Force wargame called Air Force Wargame: Indo-Pacific (AFWI).
Wargames are the Air Force's way of practicing strategic thinking in preparation for future fights.
Since high school, the aforementioned Multimedia course, I have been interested in game design.
We did not learn it in that course, but it has always interested me.
Building a video game off a fairly complex board game should be a tough but accomplishable challenge, fitting for both my CompSci skills and AFROTC background.
