## Professional Biography
Tyler Brunelle is a senior Computer Science student at the University of Cincinnati.
Before attending UC, he grew up in Columbus, Ohio.
Much of his youth was spent in a pool, either competitively swimming or playing water polo.
A strong student, he enjoyed my studies, particularly math and science.
Eventually finding his way into a Multimedia course, which taught basic animation, graphic design, progrmaming, and web design.
In 2021, I graduated with honors from Pickerington High School North.  

Now at Cincinnati, studying CompSci thanks to that high school Multimedia course, he thrived in the intro engineering and programming courses.
However, during his first co-op, something was missing.
A sense of structure, a strong community, and fellow motivated individuals.
Fortunately, he found that through the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) program at UC.
Through that program, he has gained valuable communication, critical thinking, and leadership skills.
The community and sense of belonging were found.  

Going into his fifth and final year here at UC, he is excited to take on the challenge of this Senior Design project!

## Project Sought
Create a video game version of a board game.
The board game in question, an Air Force wargame called Air Force Wargame: Indo-Pacific (AFWI).
Wargames are the Air Force's way of practicing strategic thinking in preparation for future fights.
Since high school, the aforementioned Multimedia course, there has been a lingering interest in game design.
Building a video game off a fairly complex board game should be a tough but accomplishable challenge, fitting for both CompSci skills and AFROTC background.
