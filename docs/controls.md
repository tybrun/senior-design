# Controls & UI

This page explains how to interact with the game UI.

> Replace placeholders once your controls are finalized. The goal is to keep this page short and practical.

## Main screens you may see
- **Main Menu:** Start Game, Load Game, Settings, Quit
- **Board View:** tokens, bases, tracks, range bands
- **Hand / Cards View:** squadron cards, enabler cards, discard piles
- **Log / Event Feed:** dice rolls, acquisitions, shots, phase changes

## Mouse controls (typical)
- **Select token/card:** Left-click
- **Confirm action:** Click a button (e.g., “Confirm Move”, “End Turn”)
- **Cancel:** Right-click or `Esc` (if supported)

## Common actions (typical)
### Move
1. Select a friendly token
2. Choose a destination (band/space)
3. Confirm

### Acquire
1. Select an acquiring unit (sensor)
2. Select an enemy face-down token in range
3. Roll/resolve acquisition
4. If successful, the token flips face up (revealed)

### Shoot
1. Select shooter
2. Select target (usually must be acquired/known)
3. Roll/resolve attack
4. Apply damage/markers

## Keyboard shortcuts (optional)
If implemented, document them here:
- `Esc` — Cancel / back
- `Space` — End turn
- `H` — Help overlay

## UI tips
- Face-down tokens usually mean “unknown to the enemy.”
- Tooltips (hover) should explain token stats and allowed actions (if implemented).
