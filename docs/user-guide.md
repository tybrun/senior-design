# User Guide (How-To)

This guide is for players who want to run the game and play a match without reading every rule detail.

## What is this project?
**AFWI Virtual** is a digital version of the AFWI board game. Players take the role of a side (e.g., US or PRC),
manage squadrons and enablers, and score victory points (VP) across one or more **ATO cycles**.

## Getting started
1. Install and run the project: [Installation](installation.md)
2. Launch the game
3. Start a new game (or load a saved game if supported)

## The main loop at a glance
Most games are structured like:
1. **Campaign setup** (choose mission/scenario)
2. **ATO cycle begins** (choose posture, draw cards, place squadrons)
3. **Turns** alternate until both players pass
4. **ATO cycle ends** and the next begins (until campaign end)

If you don’t know what any of those words mean yet—don’t worry. The walkthrough below will get you playing.

## Typical “first game” recommendation
For your first time:
- Use a short campaign (1–2 ATO cycles)
- Focus on squadron activation + MAS (Move/Acquire/Shoot)
- Use only a few enablers until the basics feel comfortable

## Your turn: what can I do?
On your turn, you generally do **one** of the following:
- **Play an Enabler card** (apply its effect)
- **Activate a Squadron** (deploy tokens face down from that squadron)
- **MAS**: Move / Acquire / Shoot using eligible tokens
- **Pass**

> Your specific build may implement these steps slightly differently. If the UI labels differ, follow the UI.

## Fog-of-war (hidden tokens)
Many tokens begin **face down**. This represents uncertainty: your opponent does not know what the token is until it’s
**acquired** (revealed) by sensors or game effects.

## Ending an ATO cycle
When both players pass, the ATO cycle ends and you proceed to the next cycle (if any). Scoring usually happens at the end
of the campaign.
